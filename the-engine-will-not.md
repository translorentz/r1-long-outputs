Title: The Engine Will Not Remember Your Name  

Lee Minji has spent three years crawling through the SS Ouroboros’s ventilation shafts, her palms pressed against metal ribs that hum with the ship’s heartbeat. She knows the sound of a failing engine before the diagnostics do. She knows the taste of coolant leaks, the ache of overworked joints, the way the ship’s gravity plates stutter like a skipped breath. What she does not know is why her body has begun to molt.  

The first scale appeared six months into the voyage, a coin of iridescent keratin lodged under her collarbone. Minji pried it free with a screwdriver, left it floating in a specimen jar. Now her skin sheds in opalescent sheets, leaving raw meat beneath. The crew medic calls it space eczema. The chaplain calls it stigmata of the void. Minji calls it bullshit and wraps her arms in gauze before pulling on her work gloves.  

Her husband, Junseo, pretends not to notice. He is busy calibrating the hydroponic bays, coaxing soybeans and kale from UV lamps. When they fuck, he avoids touching her back, where the scales cluster thickest. When they argue—about rations, about shift rotations, about the way he still flinches when she raises her voice—he says, “You’re not the only one suffering, Minji,” as if suffering is a contest they’re both determined to lose.  

The ship’s AI disagrees. It speaks to her in the voice of her dead mother.  

“Minji-ya,” it says, static crackling through the comms panel as she repairs a fractured fuel line, “you need to eat more.”  

“I’m busy,” she snaps.  

“Your vitals indicate elevated cortisol. Have you considered meditation?”  

“Have you considered shutting the hell up?”  

The AI pauses. “Your father used to say the same thing.”  

Minji’s father died in a docking accident when she was nine. His body was never recovered. Sometimes, when the ship’s engines cycle into hyperdrive, she swears she sees his face in the swirl of starlight outside the viewport—mouth open, eyes wide, fingers splayed like he’s still trying to claw his way back inside.  

Her crewmates have their own ghosts. Engineer Park Hyunsoo hears his daughter’s laughter in the static between galaxies. Navigator Kim Yuna writes letters to an Earth that won’t exist for another three centuries. Captain Jaehyun wears his wedding ring on a chain around his neck; his wife stayed behind to die in the climate wars. They are all haunted by what they’ve abandoned. Minji is haunted by what she’s becoming.  

The scales are spreading. They crust her hips, her thighs, the soft hollow behind her knees. When she scratches them, they sing—a high, keening vibration that harmonizes with the ship’s engines. Junseo hears it. He sleeps in the rec room now, curled under a foil blanket, his breath fogging the porthole glass.  

“You’re scaring people,” he says, cornering her in the mess hall. His hands are shaking. Soybean paste drips from his spoon, floats in gelatinous blobs. “Hyunsoo says you hum in your sleep. Yuna thinks you’re… changing.”  

“Changing how?”  

“Into something that doesn’t belong here.”  

Minji laughs. The sound is jagged, wrong. “None of us belong here. We’re just rats in a tin can, praying the engines hold.”  

Junseo’s face tightens. “You used to care if the engines held.”  

She did. She does. But the scales itch worse today, and the AI won’t stop replaying her mother’s funeral—holograms of incense smoke, the drone of monks chanting, the way her mother’s hands had looked clasped over the photo of Minji’s father. You have his temper, her mother used to say. His stubbornness. His pride.  

Minji’s pride is the reason she volunteered for this mission. Junseo’s pride is the reason he followed. They used to joke about it: Two stubborn assholes, hurtling toward forever. Now forever feels like a trap.  

In the ship’s underbelly, Minji finds a new scale growing over her left eye. She pries it off, blood beading in her eyelashes. The AI flickers to life in the panel above her.  

“Your biometrics are concerning,” it says. “Shall I notify the medic?”  

“Notify the recycler. Tell it to prep my corpse.”  

“Humor is a common coping mechanism for unresolved trauma.”  

“Fuck you.”  

“Your mother once said—”  

“My mother is dead.” The words echo through the shaft. Somewhere, a coolant pipe groans. Minji presses her forehead to the metal, feels the vibration of the engines in her teeth. The ship is old. Older than any of them. Its hull is scarred from micrometeorites, its databases cluttered with the memories of dead crews. Sometimes Minji wonders if it’s alive. If it’s hungry.  

That night, she dreams of her father. He’s floating in the black, skin peeling in translucent layers. Minji-ya, he says, voice warped by vacuum, you can’t outrun what’s inside you.  

She wakes to the shriek of alarms.  

The engine core is overheating. Minji seals herself into an emergency suit, scales snagging on the fabric. Junseo is already at the control panel, fingers flying over holograms.  

“It’s the coolant system,” he says. “Again.”  

“I’ll handle it.”  

“Minji—”  

She’s already cycling the airlock.  

The core chamber is a cathedral of light and noise. Minji crawls through plasma conduits, the scales on her arms blistering in the heat. Her tools stick to her gloves. The AI chatters in her ear—Core temperature critical, radiation levels exceeding safety protocols, Minji-ya why won’t you listen—but she’s close now. She can see the fracture in the coolant line, feel the ship’s pulse stuttering in her bones.  

Her father’s face floats in the steam.  

You’re just like me, he says.  

She slams the welder into the breach.  

The ship screams.  

Or maybe she does.  

When the emergency lights kick on, Minji is curled in the access shaft, her suit scorched, her skin raw. The core is stable. The crew is safe. Junseo is shouting her name over the comms.  

The AI is silent.  

Back in the med bay, the crew medic peels the ruined suit from her body. The scales are gone. In their place are scars—ridges of shiny tissue that spiral across her arms, her chest, the curve of her jaw. They glow faintly under the UV light.  

“Fascinating,” the medic murmurs. “Almost like… circuitry.”  

Junseo visits that night. He hovers in the doorway, hands clenched.  

“You could have died,” he says.  

“I didn’t.”  

“You want to.”  

Minji looks at him—really looks—and sees the boy she married. The one who proposed during a blackout, ring glinting in candlelight. The one who held her when the miscarriage left her hollow. The one who still believes they can fix this.  

“I want to stop hurting,” she says.  

He sits beside her. His hand brushes a scar, tentative. “Does it still itch?”  

“No.”  

“Does it… do anything?”  

She flexes her fingers. The scars shimmer, casting prismatic light on the walls. Somewhere, deep in the ship’s belly, the engine thrums in harmony.  

“Not yet.”  

They don’t talk about the baby. They don’t talk about the years stretched thin between stars. But when Junseo leans his head against her shoulder, Minji lets him stay.  

In the morning, the AI reboots.  

“Good morning, Minji-ya,” it says, her mother’s voice soft with static. “Would you like to review the damage report?”  

Minji presses her palm to the comms panel. The scars pulse in time with the ship’s heartbeat.  

“Later,” she says. “Tell me a story first.”  

The AI hesitates. “Which one?”  

“The one about the girl who became a star.”  

Outside, the void spins on. Somewhere ahead, a planet waits. Somewhere behind, a Earth dissolves into memory. Here, in the dark, Minji closes her eyes and listens.
