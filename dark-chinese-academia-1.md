**The Persimmon Tree’s First Leaf (Extended)**  
Autumn at Jixia Academy was less a season than a prolonged elegy, the air thick with the musk of decaying scrolls and the metallic tang of unanswered questions. The persimmon tree, its branches clawing at the gray Linzi sky, had always been a site of contention—not merely because its fruit fell prematurely, blighting the cobblestones with sticky, unripe rot, but because it stood at the crossroads of the academy’s three courtyards: the Hall of Rectified Names, the Scriptorium of Silent Scribes, and the dormitory where disciples slept fitfully, their dreams invaded by the ghosts of rival philosophers. It was here, on a morning veiled in mist so dense it seemed to swallow sound itself, that Wei Zhong’s absence was first noted. His desk, an island of chaos in the Scriptorium’s sea of order, bore the marks of a mind mid-leap: bamboo slips fanned out like a crane’s damaged wing, their carved characters still glistening with wet lacquer; a half-empty inkwell, its contents thickened into a tar-like paste; and, most peculiarly, a single persimmon leaf, its edges singed as if held too close to a candle flame. Xun Qing, upon inspecting the scene, had ordered the leaf preserved in a bronze censer—a gesture less of reverence than of forensic curiosity. “Even fire,” he murmured to his disciples, “leaves a shadow of its hunger.”  

Li Si, whose mind was a loom perpetually weaving patterns from disparate threads, had already reconstructed the final hours of Wei Zhong’s presence. The man had been seen at the third watch of the night, arguing with the kitchen steward over the quality of millet—a petty dispute, but one that revealed Wei Zhong’s fastidiousness. He had then retreated to the Scriptorium, where the rasp of his knife splitting bamboo had echoed until dawn. Yet the slips he left behind were not drafts of a treatise but meticulous copies of military dispatches from Qin, intercepted and smuggled into Qi by unknown hands. Han Fei, whose loyalty to Legalist principles warred with his fascination for Wei Zhong’s unorthodox mind, had suggested the writings were a cipher. “Chaos,” he declared, his stutter smoothing into icy clarity, “is a language. To decode it is to court heresy.” Li Si, tracing a fingertip over the characters for *crossbow formation*, had countered: “Heresy is the first dialect of power. Qin speaks it fluently.” Their eyes met—a collision of ideologies and something warmer, more perilous—before Xun Qing silenced them with a raised hand. “To debate the intent of a missing man,” he said, “is to pour wine for a ghost. Let the dead accuse themselves.”  

Yet the dead, as the disciples soon learned, were not without advocates. Three nights after Wei Zhong’s disappearance, a novice scrubbing the Scriptorium floors discovered a slip lodged between two floorboards—a slender strip of bamboo carved with a single column of text: *The sage rules not by illuminating virtue, but by mastering the art of shadows.* The words were unmistakably Wei Zhong’s, though their context baffled even Xun Qing. The discovery ignited a fervor among the disciples, who began combing the academy for further fragments, their zeal fueled by the unspoken hope that solving the riddle might elevate them in their teacher’s esteem. Han Fei, ever the purist, dismissed the search as “the delirium of minds unmoored from principle,” yet Li Si noted how his rival’s fingers lingered on the edges of the recovered slip, as though reading not just the characters but the pressure of the knife that had carved them. “You think him alive,” Li Si ventured one evening as they walked the mulberry groves, their robes catching on thorns. Han Fei’s jaw tightened. “I think him irrelevant. A man who leaves only riddles is a man who fears his own thesis.” Li Si smiled—a rare, sharp crescent. “Or a man who knows his audience prefers mysteries to truths.”  

The audience, as it turned out, was broader than either had imagined. On the seventh day of the search, a traveling ink-seller from Chu arrived at the academy gates, bearing a bundle of bamboo slips allegedly purchased from Wei Zhong a month prior. The slips, when examined, contained not military diagrams but love poems addressed to a woman of the Qi court—lyrical, almost saccharine verses that clashed violently with Wei Zhong’s reputation as a stoic strategist. Xun Qing, sensing a trap, ordered the ink-seller detained, but the man vanished overnight, leaving behind only a vial of vermilion pigment and a lock of hair tied with red string. The incident fractured the disciples into factions: some argued Wei Zhong had been a spy, others a romantic fool, still others a pawn in a larger game orchestrated by Qin to destabilize Qi’s intellectual elite. Han Fei, in a rare outburst, accused Li Si of planting the poems to sow discord. “You’ve always preferred complexity to clarity,” he spat, his stutter returning in jagged bursts. Li Si, reclining on a meditation mat with the languor of a predator, replied: “Clarity is the banner under which tyrants march. You of all people should know that.” The accusation hung between them, a taut wire thrumming with subtext.  

It was the persimmon tree that offered the next clue—or perhaps the next illusion. On the morning of the autumn equinox, a groundskeeper found a bundle of slips nestled in the crook of its largest branch, wrapped in silk embroidered with the crest of Qi’s prime minister. The contents were incendiary: a treatise condemning Jixia Academy as a den of sedition, its scholars more devoted to “the prostitution of principles” than to the state. The author’s name had been scraped away, but the calligraphy matched Wei Zhong’s precise hand. Panic licked through the academy like flame through dry grass. Disciples burned personal writings, fearing implication; tutors retreated into silence. Only Xun Qing remained unmoved. Summoning Han Fei and Li Si to his chambers, he placed the incriminating bundle on a low table between them. “You’ve read it,” he said, not a question. Han Fei nodded, his face bloodless. Li Si, ever the provocateur, lifted a slip to the window light. “The strokes are his, but the rhythm is wrong. Wei Zhong wrote like a general marshaling troops. This…” He let the slip fall. “This is the work of a courtier. All flourish, no spine.”  

Xun Qing’s gaze, usually as inscrutable as a mountain lake, flickered with approval. “And the silk?” Han Fei, seizing the fabric, ran his thumb over the embroidered crest. “Stolen. Or replicated. The prime minister would not risk his own insignia.” Li Si, leaning close enough that his sleeve brushed Han Fei’s wrist, added: “Unless he wanted it found. Unless this is a warning.” For a long moment, the three men sat suspended in the logic of the unspoken—the realization that Wei Zhong, whether traitor or pawn, had become a weapon aimed at the academy’s heart. Xun Qing rose, his shadow swallowing the scrolls on the wall. “A tree that bears poisoned fruit,” he said, “must be pruned to its roots. But first, we must taste the poison.”  

That night, Li Si and Han Fei met beneath the persimmon tree, not as rivals but as accomplices. The moon, a sliver of bone, cast their intertwined shadows on the cobblestones. “You’ll go to the prime minister,” Han Fei said, resignation roughening his voice. “Use your talent for… persuasion.” Li Si’s laugh was a low vibration. “And you? Will you burn the Scriptorium to purify our legacy?” Han Fei’s hand found Li Si’s, their fingers knotting like roots. “I’ll prune the tree.” The pact, sealed in silence, carried the weight of all they would not confess: that the search for Wei Zhong had become a mirror, revealing not a missing scholar but the fractures in their own convictions. When they parted, Li Si carried the scent of burnt lacquer with him—a souvenir of the censer where the first leaf had been kept. Han Fei, alone now, pressed his palm to the tree’s gnarled trunk and wondered if guilt, like ink, could seep into the grain of things, staining even the fruit yet unborn.  

In the days that followed, the academy became a theater of veiled maneuvers. Li Si, leveraging his burgeoning reputation as a legal theorist, gained audience with the prime minister and subtly insinuated that the silk’s crest might be a Qin forgery—a ploy to turn Qi’s leaders against their own intellectuals. Han Fei, armed with Xun Qing’s tacit blessing, purged the Scriptorium of every text bearing Wei Zhong’s hand, his knife scraping bamboo with a surgeon’s precision. Yet in the privacy of his quarters, he preserved one slip—the original fragment about shadows and sages—tucking it into the folds of his sash, where the silk’s edge chafed his hip like a secret.  

The persimmon tree, perhaps sensing the futility of resistance, shed its remaining fruit in a single storm. The disciples, sweeping the courtyard at dawn, found the ground littered with green orbs burst open, their seeds exposed like tiny, accusing tongues. Xun Qing, observing the carnage, dictated a new lecture: “On the Necessity of Unripe Harvests.” “A fruit plucked early,” he intoned, “is a lesson in humility. It reminds us that not all truths ripen sweetly. Some must be swallowed bitter, that we may learn to discern poison from nourishment.” Han Fei, transcribing the words, felt the hidden slip burn against his skin. Li Si, listening from the back of the hall, understood the message was not for the disciples, but for him—a final test of his loyalty to Qi’s ideals versus his hunger for Qin’s rising star.  

When the first frost came, glazing the persimmon tree in silver, Wei Zhong’s fate remained a mystery. Yet in the space between Han Fei’s rigor and Li Si’s ambition, between the burned texts and the forged silk, a deeper truth had taken root: that the pursuit of knowledge, like the tree itself, demanded the sacrifice of certain fruits to preserve the integrity of the whole. What none could foresee—least of all Xun Qing, whose wisdom had always been retrospective—was how many more harvests would sour before the roots could be saved.

**The Ink-Stained Fingernails (Extended)**  
Han Fei’s aversion to the scriptorium was not born of disgust but of kinship. The room’s very air—a broth of glue-steam and bamboo dust—carried traces of Wei Zhong’s restless intellect, and to inhale it was to feel the man’s ghost lodge in the lungs. Each knife-gouged slip, each inkblot on the low tables, seemed to whisper the dead scholar’s heresies: *Law without fluidity is a noose; order without mercy is a tomb.* Han Fei had memorized these lines despite himself, their rhythm syncing with his pulse during sleepless nights. Yet it was not Wei Zhong’s words that haunted him, but his hands. The late scholar’s fingers, perpetually stained blue from inkstone grinding, had become mythologized among the disciples. *He wrote until his blood turned to ink*, they murmured, a romantic lie that ignored the mundane truth: Wei Zhong had simply been too frugal to wash. Now, avoiding the scriptorium’s accusing silence, Han Fei wandered the mulberry groves beyond the academy walls, where silkworms spun their cocoons in devout ignorance. Here, amid leaves chewed into lace, he could almost forget the paradox gnawing at him: that to erase Wei Zhong’s legacy was to become his collaborator.  

Li Si, by contrast, treated the scriptorium as a lover’s bedchamber. He arrived each dawn, sleeves rolled to the elbow, and worked until his own nails blackened—not with ink, but with the soot of the brazier where he burned rejected drafts. His project? A treatise reconciling Xun Qing’s *Rectifying Names* with Qin’s expansionist policies, a task requiring the intellectual dexterity of a acrobat. Yet his focus was porous. Between brushstrokes, he found himself studying the grooves Wei Zhong’s knife had left in the writing desk, tracing their paths like a seer reading cracks in oracle bones. One afternoon, driven by a compulsion he refused to name, he pried loose a splinter from the desk’s edge—a sliver of cedar impregnated with lacquer and the faintest smear of blue. He slid it into his sash, a relic of a man he’d never admired but now could not stop dissecting.  

Their paths collided in the mulberry groves at twilight, a time when shadows pooled like spilled ink beneath the trees. Han Fei, clutching a bamboo slip etched with Wei Zhong’s final poem, did not hear Li Si approach. The crunch of dried leaves underfoot startled him; the slip slipped from his grasp. Li Si retrieved it, his eyes scanning the characters before Han Fei could snatch it back. “*The sage embraces disorder*,” he read aloud, voice tinged with mockery. “You’d quote a heretic to refute him?” Han Fei’s stutter surged, a dam breaking. “I-I-I study the enemy to d-d-destroy him.” Li Si stepped closer, the slip held aloft like a captured banner. “You study him because he’s the one who got away. The fox who chewed through the trap.” A gust stirred the mulberry leaves, their perforated shapes casting coin-sized shadows on Han Fei’s face. “And y-y-you?” he challenged. “You hoard his leavings like a crow with s-s-shiny trinkets.”  

The accusation hung between them, taut as a bowstring. Li Si’s smile was a blade sheathed in silk. “Trinkets are tools. A crow uses broken glass to cut open walnuts. What do you use, Han Fei? Your codes? Your *principles*?” He pressed the slip to Han Fei’s chest, feeling the heartbeat beneath—a frantic rhythm at odds with the other man’s rigid posture. “You want to burn him, but you can’t. Because he knew what you’ll never admit: that law is just desire in armor. Strip it away, and what’s left? This.” His thumb brushed the slip’s edge, a hair’s breadth from Han Fei’s collarbone. “A man alone with his hunger.”  

Han Fei’s hand closed around Li Si’s wrist, not to remove it but to still its tremor. The contact jolted both—a spark jumping between charged poles. For a breath, the grove ceased its rustling; even the silkworms seemed to pause mid-spin. Then Han Fei spoke, his voice scraped raw. “You think desire is a w-w-wound. I think it’s the infection. Cut it out, or it consumes.” Li Si’s free hand rose, almost involuntarily, to the splinter hidden in his sash. “You can’t cut out desire. You can only redirect it. Wei Zhong knew that. He funneled his into… this.” He flicked the slip. “A poem, a cipher, a suicide note—who knows? But it *moved*. While you and I—” His laugh was a dry leaf crushed underfoot. “We build dams. And drown in the reservoir.”  

The metaphor hung between them, swollen with subtext. Han Fei released Li Si’s wrist, but the imprint of his fingers lingered, a phantom brand. “Dams preserve,” he said, retreating into doctrine. “They make cultivation p-p-possible.” Li Si, sensing victory, pressed. “Cultivation requires decay. A mulberry tree thrives on the rot of its own fallen leaves. You’d sweep the grove clean and wonder why the silkworms starve.” He paused, savoring the flicker of doubt in Han Fei’s eyes. “Xun Qing teaches that human nature is a crooked timber. But you—you’d plane it into splinters trying to make it straight.”  

Night fell as they argued, the grove dissolving into a tapestry of shadows. When the cold drove them back to the academy, neither noticed they’d left the slip behind. It lay in the mulch, characters fading under the moon’s milky gaze. Days later, a novice would find it and present it to Xun Qing, who recognized Wei Zhong’s hand but said nothing. Instead, he placed it in the bronze censer beside the singed persimmon leaf—a pairing that whispered of arson and harvests.  

Yet the true aftermath unfolded in smaller, more intimate betrayals. Han Fei, returning to his quarters, discovered the mulberry splinter Li Si had dropped during their confrontation. He considered burning it, but instead tucked it into his copy of *The Doctrine of Legalist Principles*, where it marked a passage on punitive measures. Li Si, for his part, began wearing his sleeves unrolled, exposing forearms brushed with ink—a silent challenge to Han Fei’s fastidiousness. Their debates in the lecture hall grew sharper, laced with allusions only they understood. Once, when Han Fei cited Shang Yang’s *death by dismemberment for grain hoarders*, Li Si countered with a verse from Wei Zhong’s poem: *“The storm’s eye is the liar’s sanctuary.”* Xun Qing, presiding, noted how Han Fei’s throat constricted, how Li Si’s fingers curled around empty air.  

The grove became their clandestine agora. There, amid silkworms and shadows, they wove a secondary discourse—part duel, part courtship—that mirrored the academy’s unraveling mysteries. Han Fei, ever the architect of order, laid traps with logic; Li Si, the opportunist, sprang them with paradox. One evening, as autumn’s chill brittled the last leaves, Li Si produced a silk-wrapped bundle from his sash. Inside lay a cocoon, its threads impossibly gold. “Found it in the grove,” he said. “A silkworm fed on mulberry ink.” Han Fei, despite himself, leaned closer. “Impossible. They eat leaves, not—”  

“Not unless the leaves are inscribed.” Unwrapping the cocoon, Li Si revealed a mulberry leaf etched with microscopic characters: *The Named obey; the Nameless rule.* Wei Zhong’s hand again. Han Fei’s breath fogged the air. “You planted this.” Li Si’s smile was a sickle moon. “Did I? Or did the grove itself confess?” He pressed the cocoon into Han Fei’s palm. “Open it. See what truth hatches.”  

Han Fei recoiled, the cocoon falling to the ground. “Truth isn’t a moth to be pinned.” Li Si retrieved it, cradling the fragile shape. “No. It’s a thread. Pull it, and the whole tapestry unravels.” He pocketed the cocoon, leaving Han Fei alone with the grove’s gathering dark.  

By winter, the cocoon’s silk would line Li Si’s proposal to Qin’s emissary—a document advocating the standardization of script to “unify desire under law.” Han Fei, upon reading it, would recognize Wei Zhong’s phraseology twisted into a tool of empire. He’d burn his copy, but not before transcribing the lines that haunted him: *The Nameless rule.* In the ashes, he’d find a mulberry splinter, carbonized but intact—a relic of the self he’d immolated to preserve the dam.  

And the grove? It endured. Silkworms spun; leaves decayed. Each spring, disciples would find new cocoons, some threaded with characters no knife could carve. Xun Qing, walking the paths at dawn, would murmur to no one: “To name is to claim. To leave nameless is to conquer.” But by then, Li Si would be in Qin, and Han Fei in a cell, and Wei Zhong’s absence would have ripened into myth—a persimmon dropped too soon, its bitter seeds sown in the fertile soil of their unspoken collusion.

**The Empty Desk Ritual (Extended)**  
Xun Qing’s ritual began as an act of pedagogical theater but metastasized into a liturgy of collective unease. Each dawn, disciples gathered around Wei Zhong’s desk—now stripped of its chaotic scrolls but left otherwise untouched, as if preserved in lacquer—and performed the three bows mandated by their teacher. The first bow, waist bent at a perfect right angle, honored the void left by the missing scholar; the second, deeper and slower, acknowledged the futility of their search; the third, a mere inclination of the head, conceded their complicity in the mystery. Offerings of millet and salt were laid on the desk’s edge, though by midday the grains would inevitably scatter, swept aside by drafts or the sleeves of passing scribes. The disciples whispered that Wei Zhong’s ghost partook of these offerings, his spectral fingers rearranging the grains into cryptic sigils. Xun Qing dismissed such talk as “the superstition of untrained minds,” yet he noted how the ritual’s strict formalism frayed at the edges, yielding to improvisation. Li Si, for instance, began arriving early to position the millet in precise quadrants, mimicking the deployment of Qi’s border garrisons. Han Fei, in turn, salted the grains with a trembling hand, his sleeves slipping to reveal fresh characters carved into his forearm: *Names are cages for unruly things.*  

The desk became a palimpsest of their obsessions. One morning, a novice discovered a Qin arrowhead nestled among the millet—a relic from the academy’s armory, its bronze tip still flecked with old blood. Xun Qing, summoning the disciples, held it aloft and declared, “To pollute absence with presence is to confess fear of the unknown.” Li Si, studying the arrowhead’s serrations, recognized it as identical to those depicted in Wei Zhong’s military diagrams. That night, he slipped into the armory, comparing the relic to others in Qi’s arsenal. The match was exact, yet the armory’s ledger showed no such arrowhead missing. When he reported this to Xun Qing, the teacher merely nodded. “Absence,” he said, “is a vessel. What we pour into it reveals more than what we take out.”  

Han Fei’s contributions were subtler, more visceral. Each night, after the scriptorium emptied, he knelt before the desk and pressed his forehead to its surface, inhaling the scent of lacquer and mildew. Sometimes, in the wood’s grain, he glimpsed the ghost of Wei Zhong’s final poem—*The storm’s eye is the liar’s sanctuary*—its characters swimming like minnows under ice. One evening, driven by a compulsion he refused to name, he scored the desk’s edge with his calligraphy knife, replicating the poem’s opening line. The act, both desecration and homage, left him trembling. When Li Si discovered the vandalism the next dawn, he traced the fresh grooves with a mix of awe and fury. “You think to trap his ghost in wood?” he hissed, cornering Han Fei in the mulberry grove. Han Fei, clutching his bandaged forearm, retorted, “I think to g-give him a voice. Even liars deserve s-sanctuary.”  

Their clandestine dialogues seeped into the ritual’s fabric. Li Si, defying Xun Qing’s injunction against “narrative pollution,” began scribbling notes on bamboo slips and wedging them into the desk’s cracks. These were not messages but provocations: quotes from Shang Yang’s penal codes, snippets of border ballads, even a crude map of Qin’s latest territorial advances. Han Fei, tasked with purging the desk each dusk, pocketed these slips instead of burning them. In the privacy of his quarters, he arranged them into a mosaic that mirrored Wei Zhong’s original diagrams—a fortress of law encircling a hollow center. Only when Li Si’s map appeared, marked with a single character (*here*), did Han Fei grasp the game: they were collaborating on Wei Zhong’s unfinished treatise, using the desk as a cipher.  

The ritual’s corruption reached its zenith on the winter solstice. A disciple, bowing too zealously, knocked over the millet bowl, scattering grains across the floor. As the novices scrambled to collect them, a cry pierced the hall: beneath the bowl’s base lay a silk scrap embroidered with Wei Zhong’s initials. The fabric, singed at the edges, bore a stain that might have been ink or blood. Xun Qing, examining it, pronounced the stain “too deliberate to be accident, too ambiguous to be evidence.” Li Si, however, recognized the silk’s weave—identical to that of the prime minister’s crest. That afternoon, he confronted Han Fei in the grove, brandishing the scrap like a prosecutor’s exhibit. “You planted this. To implicate the court.” Han Fei, his breath visible in the cold, shook his head. “The d-desk is the only witness. Ask it.”  

Their standoff birthed a new ritual. That night, Li Si began leaving his own offerings: not millet but mulberry leaves etched with legal precedents. Han Fei responded with ash from the scriptorium’s brazier, sprinkled in patterns that mocked Li Si’s logic. The desk, once a monument to absence, became a battleground for their competing orthodoxies. Xun Qing, observing silently, intervened only once—to place a persimmon seed atop Li Si’s latest leaf. “Even poison,” he remarked, “contains the blueprint of a tree.”  

The seed, planted in a cracked inkstone by a superstitious novice, sprouted by spring. Its tendril, pale as a scholar’s wrist, curled toward the sunlight filtering through the scriptorium’s lattice. Disciples debated its significance: a sign of Wei Zhong’s return, a portent of Qi’s decline, a mere botanical anomaly. Han Fei, trimming the shoot with his knife, found a silk thread coiled in its roots—red, like the string from the ink-seller’s hair. Li Si, watching him, understood: the ritual had never been about Wei Zhong. It was a mirror, reflecting their own entangled ambitions back at them, warped and magnified.  

When the Qin emissary arrived that summer, her gaze lingered on the persimmon sapling. “A curious shrine,” she remarked to Xun Qing. “Do you worship absence here, or cultivate it?” The teacher, stroking the sapling’s leaves, replied, “We irrigate it with questions. What grows is beyond our control.” That night, Li Si uprooted the sapling and presented it to the emissary as a “gesture of scholarly goodwill.” Han Fei, discovering the empty inkstone, carved a final phrase into his forearm: *Harvests betray the gardener.* The wound festered, but he wore the rot like a scholar’s seal—a testament to truths too unruly for names.  

By autumn, the ritual dissolved. Wei Zhong’s desk, stripped of offerings, gathered dust until a novice scrubbed it clean, erasing even the memory of grooves. Yet in the mulberry grove, a new tree grew where Li Si had buried the sapling—its fruit hard and green, refusing to ripen. Xun Qing, walking past it, would murmur lines from Wei Zhong’s poem, now etched into his memory. And in Qin, Li Si kept a persimmon seed in his inkstone, its shell cracked just enough to let the roots begin.

**The Frost-Bitten Symposium (Extended)**  
The symposium convened on the coldest night Linzi had endured in a generation, a chill so profound it seemed to freeze time itself. Icicles daggered from the academy’s eaves, their tips brushing the disciples’ shoulders as they filed into the debate hall—a cavernous space heated only by the friction of clashing ideologies. Xun Qing presided from a dais draped in bear pelts, his breath crystallizing into ephemeral scrolls of doctrine. The agenda, per tradition, was a free exchange on the nature of human desire, but the ghost of Wei Zhong haunted the room like a fourth element, his absence a lodestone warping every argument. Han Fei, seated rigidly at the leftmost bench, had prepared a discourse on Legalism as “the mortification of want,” but his bamboo slips lay untouched. Across the aisle, Li Si lounged with contrived nonchalance, toying with a mulberry twig he’d whittled into a quill. Between them stretched an invisible wire, thrumming with every breath.  

The first speaker, a novice from Chu, invoked Mencius’ “innate benevolence,” his voice cracking like thin ice. Han Fei’s rebuttal was swift, his stutter smoothed by the cold’s cruel clarity: “B-Benevolence untempered by law is a well without walls—any beast may drink, any fool may drown.” Li Si, twirling his makeshift quill, countered with a line from Wei Zhong’s recovered poems: *“The heart’s law is written in flood, not stone.”* Murmurs rippled through the disciples. Xun Qing’s gaze sharpened, but he withheld censure, allowing the heresy to linger. The room’s temperature plunged further.  

As the debate devolved into a volley of decontextualized quotes, Han Fei found himself unmoored. Each of Li Si’s interjections—*“Can desire be rectified if it is the rectifier’s compass?”*; *“To name a hunger is to confess it cannot be fed”*—carried a subtext that bypassed his intellect and seared his gut. When Li Si cited the *Zhuangzi*—“The sage sleeps without dreams and wakes without worries”—Han Fei’s restraint snapped. “The sage aw-w-wakes to a world *built* by those who dream!” he shouted, palm slamming the bench. A bamboo slip splintered under his hand, its edge drawing blood. Li Si’s nostrils flared, scenting the iron tang. “Dreams require sleep,” he purred. “And sleep requires surrender. Tell me, Han Fei—when was the last time you surrendered?”  

The provocation hung suspended, a spider’s thread glinting with frost. Xun Qing intervened, not with words but with a gesture—a slow unclenching of his fist, as if releasing a captive moth. “To debate desire,” he intoned, “is to sketch a flame and call it warmth. Proceed.”  

The disciples, bewildered, fell into a silence punctuated by the creak of rafters contracting in the cold. Li Si, seizing the void, stood and began circling Han Fei’s bench. His mulberry quill sketched arcs in the air, each pass conjuring a new metaphor. “Desire is the ink that bleeds through the silk of law. Try to dam it, and you’ll drown in the flood. Redirect it, and it carves canyons.” Han Fei, tracking Li Si’s orbit, felt the room’s axis tilt. “L-Law is the canyon,” he rasped. “Without it, the flood scatters into m-mud.” Li Si halted, looming over him. “Mud breeds lotuses. What does your canyon breed, Han Fei? Echoes?”  

Their faces were a hand’s breadth apart. Han Fei’s blood dripped onto the splintered slip, pooling around a character for *restraint*. Li Si’s free hand drifted toward the stain, halted, curled into a fist. The disciples leaned forward, breath held. Xun Qing closed his eyes.  

A scream shattered the tableau.  

Outside, a servant girl knelt beneath the persimmon tree, her lantern illuminating a fissure in the trunk where snowmelt had pried apart the bark. Nestled in the crevasse, cradled by roots blackened by rot, lay Wei Zhong’s inkstone—its hollow belly packed with ash. The symposium emptied, disciples spilling into the courtyard like ink from an overturned well. Xun Qing alone remained seated, fingertips pressed to his temples. When Han Fei and Li Si returned, shivering and ash-flecked, they found their teacher dissecting the inkstone with a surgeon’s precision. “Poplar ash,” he pronounced. “Mixed with mulberry pollen. A recipe for ink that refuses to adhere to bamboo.”  

The discovery unraveled the academy’s fragile consensus. Wei Zhong, it seemed, had been experimenting with unstable pigments—perhaps to encode messages, perhaps to sabotage his own legacy. The disciples fractured into camps: those who claimed the ash was proof of treason (he’d been crafting fire arrows for Qin); those who saw it as alchemical innovation (a new medium for Legalist edicts); and those who whispered that the ash was human, a funerary relic smuggled into Qi. Han Fei, tasked with cataloging the inkstone’s residue, detected a familiar scent beneath the carbon—sandalwood, the signature perfume of the prime minister’s court. Li Si, reviewing border tax records, found a shipment of sandalwood logs destined for Wei Zhong’s home village. The threads of coincidence braided into a noose.  

That night, Han Fei confronted Li Si in the scriptorium, brandishing a sandalwood splinter. “You planted this in the inkstone. To implicate the prime minister.” Li Si, grinding a lump of poplar ash into powder, didn’t look up. “Or to expose him. The difference is academic.” Han Fei’s fist clenched. “Truth isn’t academic. It’s the g-ground we build on.” Li Si finally met his gaze, eyes glinting with borrowed moonlight. “Wei Zhong’s truth was a quicksand pit. You’re standing knee-deep in it, demanding I hand you a shovel.”  

Their standoff was interrupted by a novice bearing a message: the persimmon tree had split entirely, its trunk splayed open to reveal a honeycomb of tunnels carved by termites. The insects, drunk on fermented sap, staggered through the snow—a living metaphor for the academy’s decay. Xun Qing ordered the tree felled and its wood burned, but Li Si salvaged a branch, whittling it into a seal stamp. Han Fei, retrieving a fragment of termite-chewed bark, found it etched with the faintest traces of Wei Zhong’s knife—a half-formed character that could be read as *loyalty* or *betrayal*, depending on the angle of light.  

The symposium reconvened at dawn, but the disciples’ fervor had calcified into ritual. Arguments were recited, not felt; objections, when raised, were perfunctory. Only Han Fei and Li Si dueled with undiminished intensity, their clashes now devoid of audience. “You’ve made a shrine of his absence,” Han Fei accused, gesturing to the inkstone, now displayed like a reliquary. Li Si’s reply was a smile, sharp as a splinter. “Absence is the only oracle left. It tells us what we dare not ask.”  

When the first thaw came, the disciples discovered Li Si’s seal stamp embedded in the scriptorium’s threshold—a crude impression reading *The Nameless*. Han Fei, tasked with removing it, found the characters had bled into the wood, indelible as regret. That night, he lay the stamp on Xun Qing’s dais, along with the termite-scarred bark. “You let this fester,” he said, the accusation more wounded than wrathful. Xun Qing rotated the stamp, studying its grooves. “Festering precedes healing. A lesson for surgeons, not scholars.”  

As spring’s false warmth coaxed buds from the mulberry grove, the symposium’s ashes were swept into the academy’s well—a symbolic interment that contaminated the water for weeks. Han Fei took to drinking wine instead, its burn a poor substitute for the heat of debate. Li Si, drafting his treatise for Qin, diluted his ink with well-water, savoring the grit between his teeth. When the emissary arrived to collect him, she brought a gift: a sandalwood chest filled with poplar ash. “From Chancellor Lü,” she said. “For your… experiments.”  

The persimmon tree’s stump sprouted fungus by summer—a shelf-like growth veined with blue, as if the roots had absorbed Wei Zhong’s ink. Xun Qing ordered it excised, but the spores had already spread. By the time Han Fei drank his last cup of wine, the academy’s beams would creak under the weight of ghostly fruiting bodies, their caps whispering dirges only the termites could hear.

**The Unmarked Slip**  

The bamboo slip lay atop Han Fei’s desk like a cipher, unblemished by ink or inscription, its surface smooth as the frozen surface of a winter pond. It had appeared in the dead of night, slipped beneath the lattice door of his chamber with a sound like a moth’s wing grazing parchment—a whisper so faint even the academy’s sleepless scribes, hunched over their oil lamps in the scriptorium, had not stirred. When Han Fei lifted it at dawn, his fingers trembled not from the cold but from the weight of its anonymity. In an academy where every thought was etched into bamboo with the precision of a blade, where even the marginalia of students bore the frantic urgency of men carving legacies into eternity, the absence of words was a provocation. It was a void that demanded filling, a silence that roared. He pressed the slip to his nose, half-expecting the tang of pine soot or the musk of lacquer, but it smelled only of the raw, green bitterness of freshly split bamboo. A blankness that refused to confess its origin.  

Li Si found him thus, cradling the slip like a relic, his scholar’s robes pooling around him in ink-black folds. The younger student lingered in the doorway, his silhouette sharp against the pallid morning light, his face a mask of practiced indifference. Yet Han Fei did not need to turn to feel the heat of his gaze—a gaze that had always been less like observation and more like excavation, as though Li Si sought to peel back the layers of Han Fei’s composure to uncover the raw, pulsing core beneath. “Another love letter from your admirers?” Li Si drawled, stepping into the room with a deliberate slowness that made the floorboards groan. His voice was light, but his eyes were knives. Han Fei did not flinch. He had long ago mastered the art of stillness, of allowing Li Si’s barbs to glance off him like arrows striking stone. “If this is a love letter,” he said, “it is written in a language neither of us understands.” He extended the slip toward Li Si, who took it with fingers that lingered a heartbeat too long on Han Fei’s palm.  

The moment hung between them, taut as a bowstring. Li Si turned the slip over, his brow furrowing as though the blankness offended him. For all his brilliance, he was a creature of systems, of codes and hierarchies, his mind a labyrinth of stratagems. An unmarked slip was an affront to his very philosophy—a philosophy that insisted even chaos could be cataloged, that every mystery was a lock awaiting its key. “It’s a test,” he said at last, his voice low. “From *him*.” He did not need to name Xun Qing. The master’s presence loomed over them both, a shadow that stretched across the academy’s courtyards and into the marrow of their debates. Xun Qing, who preached the inherent wickedness of man, who believed even the most virtuous soul required the chisel of ritual to carve it into something worthy. Xun Qing, who had once taken Han Fei aside after a lecture on the *Xunzi* and said, with a smile that did not touch his eyes, *You write as though you are building a wall between yourself and the world. But walls, too, can crumble.*  

Han Fei rose, his joints stiff from hours of kneeling. “If it is a test,” he said, “then it is one you have already failed.” He watched Li Si’s jaw tighten, the flicker of vulnerability beneath the veneer of arrogance. They had danced this dance for years—Han Fei with his quiet, coiled intensity, Li Si with his restless ambition. Their debates in the lecture hall were performances of fire and ice, Li Si’s words cascading like wildfire, Han Fei’s retorts precise as a surgeon’s scalpel. But here, in the privacy of Han Fei’s chamber, the stakes were different. Here, the air hummed with what they dared not name: the way Li Si’s sleeve brushed Han Fei’s arm when they reached for the same text, the way Han Fei’s breath caught when Li Si laughed—a rare, unguarded sound that seemed to unravel something deep within him.  

Li Si set the slip down with a sharp click. “You think me incapable of understanding silence?” he said, his voice edged with something perilously close to hurt. “You think I cannot see that this—” he gestured to the slip, “—is not an absence, but a mirror? It reflects nothing but the face of the one who holds it.” He leaned in, close enough that Han Fei could see the faint scar beneath his left eye—a relic of a childhood accident, a story Li Si had never shared. “What does it show *you*, Han Fei? What emptiness do you fear to confront?”  

The question hung in the air, charged as the moment before a thunderclap. Han Fei turned away, his gaze drifting to the window where the first snow of the season had begun to fall, dusting the academy’s cedar roofs like ash. He thought of the missing scribe, Zhao Liang, whose desk in the scriptorium had sat empty for nine days now. Zhao, who had once transcribed Han Fei’s essays with a reverence that bordered on devotion, whose ink-stained hands had left smudges on the bamboo slips like fingerprints of loyalty. Zhao, who had vanished the same night the unmarked slips began to appear—first in the scriptorium, then in the dormitories, then here, in the innermost sanctum of Han Fei’s solitude. Coincidence? Han Fei did not believe in coincidences. He believed in patterns, in the invisible threads that connected action to consequence, sin to retribution.  

“You speak of mirrors,” Han Fei said softly, “but what if this slip is not a mirror but a blade? What if it is meant to divide us?” He did not look at Li Si as he spoke, but he felt the other man’s stillness, the arrested breath. “You have always been too eager to conflate ambition with insight, Li Si. You think yourself the architect of your destiny, but what if you are merely a pawn in a game you cannot see?”  

Li Si’s laugh was brittle. “Spare me your riddles. You’ve been reading too much of Zhuang Zhou’s dream-talk.” He snatched the slip from the desk, his fingers whitening around its edges. “This is nothing but a piece of bamboo. A prank by some witless novice. You—”  

He froze. A sound from the corridor—a footfall, deliberate and slow. Both men turned as the door slid open, revealing Xun Qing framed in the threshold, his austere face illuminated by the frail winter light. The master’s gaze swept over them, lingering on the slip in Li Si’s hand. For a heartbeat, Han Fei thought he saw something flicker in those depthless eyes—a spark of recognition, or perhaps dread. Then it was gone, extinguished like a candle in a sudden gust.  

“Master,” Han Fei murmured, bowing low. Li Si followed suit, though his bow was shallower, a gesture of grudging respect.  

Xun Qing stepped into the room, his robes whispering against the floor like a sigh. “You are troubled by the unmarked slips,” he said, not a question but a verdict. His voice was calm, but beneath it ran a current of something darker, a subterranean tension. “They are not meant for you.”  

Li Si straightened, his eyes blazing. “Then for whom *are* they meant, Master? And why place them where we cannot help but find them?”  

Xun Qing’s expression did not change, but his hands, clasped behind his back, tightened until the knuckles blanched. “There are truths that elude even the most diligent scholar,” he said. “Truths that cannot be carved into bamboo or whispered in the lecture hall. The slips are a reminder—that for all our scrolls and debates, we are still children groping in the dark.”  

Han Fei studied his master’s face, searching for cracks in the facade. Xun Qing had always been a paradox—a man who preached order yet surrounded himself with disciples of chaos, who extolled ritual yet tolerated the fevered intellectual anarchy of Jixia. But now, for the first time, Han Fei sensed a fissure in the man’s implacable certainty. A shadow of doubt, or fear.  

“And Zhao Liang?” Han Fei asked quietly. “Is his disappearance another reminder?”  

The silence that followed was thick enough to choke on. Xun Qing turned to the window, watching the snow spiral downward. “Zhao Liang sought answers to questions that should never have been asked,” he said at last. “He peered into the abyss, and the abyss peered back.” With that, he turned and left, his footsteps receding down the corridor like a retreating tide.  

Li Si exhaled sharply, his breath misting in the cold air. “Cryptic old fool,” he muttered, though without conviction. He glanced at Han Fei, and in that moment, the mask slipped—revealing not the brash strategist, but the boy beneath, hungry and afraid. “What do we do?”  

Han Fei took the slip from Li Si’s hand, his fingers brushing against the other man’s. The bamboo was warm now, as though infused with the heat of their shared dread. “We finish what Zhao Liang started,” he said. “We look into the abyss.”  

Outside, the snow continued to fall, burying the academy in a shroud of white—a blankness as vast and impenetrable as the unmarked slip itself. But Han Fei knew better than to mistake silence for emptiness. In the gaps between words, in the spaces where ink refused to flow, the truth coiled like a serpent, waiting to strike.

**The Last Debate Beneath Rotting Fruit (Extended)**  

The persimmon tree stood as a sentinel of decay, its branches sagging under the weight of fruit that had long surrendered to rot. The once-vibrant orbs now hung like desiccated hearts, their skins blackened and split, oozing a viscous syrup that pooled on the cobblestones below. Autumn had surrendered to the first tremors of winter, and the air in Jixia Academy carried the metallic bite of impending frost, a cold that seeped into the bones of the disciples and silenced the usual murmur of debate. Yet beneath this tree, where the rot sweetened the air with a cloying, almost medicinal stench, Han Fei and Li Si faced each other for the final time. The tree’s grotesque bounty framed them—a tableau of intellectual ruin, the fruit’s decay mirroring the erosion of their once-sharp camaraderie into something jagged and unspeakable.  

Han Fei’s hands, usually steady as a scribe’s, trembled faintly as he clutched a bamboo slip etched with Wei Zhong’s last known words: *“The storm’s eye is the liar’s sanctuary.”* The characters, carved with the missing scholar’s signature precision, seemed to pulse under his fingertips, as though the ink retained some vestige of the man’s restless spirit. Li Si, ever the provocateur, leaned against the tree’s blighted trunk, his posture feigning nonchalance even as his eyes—dark, restless, endlessly calculating—tracked Han Fei’s every microexpression. Between them lay the unspoken weight of sleepless nights spent parsing Wei Zhong’s fragmented legacy, of stolen glances in the scriptorium, of arguments that had long ago transcended philosophy and veered into the realm of sacrament.  

“You look like a man holding his own epitaph,” Li Si remarked, nodding at the slip. His voice was a study in controlled mockery, but the undercurrent was raw, frayed. “Still clinging to his ghost? I thought you Legalists disdained the superstition of the dead.”  

Han Fei’s stutter, that old betrayer, surged to the fore. “I-I dis-disdain the *pretense* that the dead hold answers. Wei Zhong’s writings are not a s-spirit tablet—they’re a map. One you’ve refused to read.”  

Li Si pushed off the trunk, closing the distance between them in three fluid strides. The syrup-coated stones slicked his sandals, leaving faint trails like snail’s tracks. “A map to what? His corpse? His motives? The man was a middling philosopher and a third-rate spy. You’ve turned his scribblings into scripture because you need a *reason*—” he jabbed a finger at Han Fei’s chest, “—to justify staying here, playing the loyal disciple while Xun Qing sharpens his next set of blades.”  

The accusation hung between them, as palpable as the tree’s stench. Han Fei recoiled, not from the touch but from the truth coiled within Li Si’s words. For weeks, he’d watched Li Si drift further into the orbit of Qin’s emissaries, his once-rigorous adherence to Xun Qing’s teachings warping into a malleable pragmatism. Where Han Fei saw heresy in Wei Zhong’s alliance with Qi’s enemies, Li Si saw opportunity; where Han Fei parsed the dead man’s texts for clues, Li Si mined them for leverage. The realization had been a slow poison: they were no longer collaborators in unmasking a mystery, but rival interpreters of a corpse’s gospel.  

“This isn’t about loyalty,” Han Fei said, forcing his voice steady. “It’s about *corruption*. Wei Zhong didn’t just disappear—he was erased. His inkstone, his writings, even his *name* scrubbed from the lecture rolls. You think that’s the work of some kitchen maid’s grudge? Or a prime minister tidying his mess?”  

Li Si’s laugh was a brittle thing, sharp enough to draw blood. “And you think transcribing his half-baked epigrams will restore him? You’re a fool, Han Fei. History isn’t written by the righteous—it’s written by the ones who control the ink.” He produced a slip from his sleeve, its surface blank but for a single character—*ambition*—carved with such violence the bamboo fibers bristled. “This is what Wei Zhong understood. The rest is commentary.”  

The rot between them was not merely ideological. It was personal, intimate, a festering acknowledgment of the nights Han Fei had lingered outside Li Si’s chamber, listening to the rhythmic scrape of his knife on bamboo; of Li Si’s habit of “accidentally” brushing his hand against Han Fei’s wrist during debates, a touch that lingered just beyond the bounds of scholarly propriety. Their rivalry had always been a dialectic of desire and denial, each a mirror for the other’s unspoken hunger. Now, beneath the tree that had witnessed their first clash of intellects, that hunger threatened to consume them.  

Han Fei stepped closer, close enough to see the faint scar beneath Li Si’s left eye—a childhood wound he’d never explained, now pulsing with the rhythm of his quickened breath. “You’re wrong,” he said, his voice low, stutterless. “History is written by those who *preserve*. By men who build dams against the flood, not by those who ride the current to the nearest throne.”  

Li Si’s mask slipped. For a heartbeat, his gaze softened, revealing the boy who’d once marveled at Xun Qing’s lectures, who’d believed in the redemptive power of ideas. Then it hardened again, polished to a merciless sheen. “Dams break,” he said, almost gently. “And when they do, the flood carries everything. Even you.”  

The kiss, when it came, was not gentle. It was a clash of teeth and desperation, a release of years of coiled tension. Li Si’s hands fisted in Han Fei’s robes, pulling him flush against the tree, its bark imprinting a mosaic of pain and promise into his back. Han Fei responded with equal fury, his fingers tangling in Li Si’s hair as though to root him there, to anchor them both against the riptide of their choices. The persimmons above them shuddered, raining flecks of decay like morbid confetti.  

When they broke apart, their breath misted in the frigid air, mingling into a single ephemeral cloud. Li Si’s lips were smeared with Han Fei’s blood, a tiny split from the violence of their collision. “Come with me,” he said, the words barely audible. “Qin will burn this place to ash. Don’t let it take you too.”  

Han Fei closed his eyes, the taste of Li Si—ink and iron and something indefinably bitter—lingering on his tongue. He thought of Xun Qing’s lessons, of the brutal beauty of laws that bound chaos into order. He thought of Wei Zhong’s empty desk, of the prime minister’s silk-clad enforcers, of the way Li Si’s pulse had rabbited beneath his fingertips.  

“No,” he said.  

The word was a blade. Li Si flinched as though struck, then straightened, his face smoothing into an expression of glacial detachment. He retrieved the blank slip from the ground, brushed off a fleck of rot, and tucked it into his sash. Without another word, he turned and walked toward the academy gates, where the Qin emissary’s carriage awaited, its lacquered panels gleaming like a beetle’s carapace.  

Han Fei remained beneath the tree until the carriage vanished into the horizon’s gray embrace. When he finally moved, it was to press his palm against the trunk, the bark’s roughness a counterpoint to the memory of Li Si’s skin. Above him, a persimmon detached and burst against the stones, its syrup spreading like a shadow.  

In the days that followed, the disciples would whisper of how Han Fei took over Wei Zhong’s abandoned desk, how he transcribed every surviving fragment of the dead man’s work onto fresh bamboo slips, how he burned the originals in the academy’s ceremonial brazier. They would not see him pocket a single slip—Wei Zhong’s final, unfinished line: *The storm’s eye is*—nor notice how he traced the characters at night, his fingers moving as though to conjure the rest from the air.  

Li Si, in Qin, would rise swiftly through the ranks, his legal codes becoming the scaffolding of an empire. He would draft edicts in a hand steady as a surgeon’s, never allowing himself to dwell on the taste of blood or the feel of Han Fei’s hands in his hair. But in his private chambers, locked away from prying eyes, he would keep a persimmon seed encased in glass—a souvenir of rot, a reminder of the cost of preservation.  

And the tree? It would outlive them both. Its roots, nourished by decay, would stretch deeper into the academy’s foundations, its fruit a perennial offering to the ghosts of debates unresolved. Xun Qing, in his final lecture, would gesture to its blighted branches and say, *“Observe: the fruit’s ruin is the tree’s rebirth. So too does the scholar’s failure seed the future.”* The disciples would nod, scribbling dutifully, unaware that the old master’s gaze lingered not on the tree, but on the empty space where two boys had once stood—a space now filled with the quiet, inexorable weight of endings.

**The Uncarved Vessel**  

Winter had settled over Jixia Academy like a scholar’s silence, its courtyards frosted with brittle light and the skeletal shadows of persimmon trees clawing at the sky. The cold seeped into the lecture halls, where breath hung visible in the air, and the rustle of bamboo slips under anxious fingers echoed like the whispers of restless ghosts. Xun Qing, his beard dusted with the ash of a brazier’s dying embers, stood before his disciples, holding aloft a rough-hewn clay vessel, its surface pocked and unglazed. “Consider this,” he intoned, his voice a blade honed by decades of disputation, “the *pu*, the uncarved block. The Daoists claim it embodies the perfection of nature’s formlessness. But I say it is merely potential—a void waiting to be filled by the chisel of ritual, the knife of law.” His gaze swept over the room, lingering on Han Fei, who sat with his spine rigid as a stele, and Li Si, whose eyes flickered like candle flames in a draft. “Human nature is crooked wood. Without the artisan’s hand, it cannot be made straight.”  

Han Fei’s lips twitched, a suppressed retort trembling at the edge of articulation. His hands, pale and delicate as cicada wings, tightened around a bamboo slip inscribed with his own counterarguments—arguments he would never read aloud, his stutter clotting his brilliance into silence. Li Si, ever the pragmatist, watched him sidelong, noting the flush creeping up his neck, the way his knuckles whitened. He knew Han Fei’s mind raged against Xunzi’s dogma, a furnace of ideas choked by the ash of his speech. It stirred something in Li Si, this proximity to unspoken fire, a sensation he dissected with clinical precision even as it unsettled him. They had debated late into the night once, Han Fei’s words spilling in fragmented torrents, Li Si finishing his sentences with a surgeon’s cool exactness. The memory hung between them now, a silk curtain neither dared part.  

Days later, the vessel reappeared in the scriptorium, placed deliberately atop a stack of Han Fei’s manuscripts. Its presence was an accusation, a riddle. Li Si traced its crude contours, wondering who had left it—and why. The academy had been uneasy since the disappearance of Song Yi, a junior scribe last seen copying forbidden Mohist texts. Rumor whispered he’d been vanished by the chancellor’s agents for heresy, or worse, by his own hand in a fit of despair. But the vessel suggested darker symmetries. Han Fei entered silently, his shadow falling across the clay form. “He fears what cannot be shaped,” he muttered, the words laborious but clear. Li Si turned, startled by the directness. “Xunzi?” he ventured. Han Fei shook his head, pointing to the vessel. “The *pu*. It mocks him. To carve it is to admit the raw material is flawed. But what if the flaw is in the carver’s eye?”  

Their fingers brushed as Han Fei reached for the vessel—a contact that lingered a heartbeat too long. Li Si withdrew, his pulse a drumbeat in his throat. He envied Han Fei’s capacity to dwell in abstractions, to court ideas like lovers, while he himself navigated the world as a series of calculable risks. Yet here, in this charged proximity, calculus failed. They began to meet in secret, parsing the vessel’s mystery like a shared dream. Han Fei’s chambers, fragrant with ink and dried chrysanthemum, became a clandestine salon. One night, he revealed a slip hidden inside the vessel—a single character, 逆 (*ni*), *rebellion*, etched in vermillion. “Song Yi’s hand,” Han Fei rasped. “He wrote this before… disappearing.”  

Li Si recoiled. To possess such a slip was to invite suspicion; to hide it, complicity. Yet Han Fei’s eyes held a challenge, a dare to transcend the petty loyalties of survival. It was then Li Si understood the vessel’s true function: it was a mirror. Xunzi saw raw material to be disciplined. Han Fei saw a critique of discipline itself. And Li Si? He saw the weight of consequence, the cost of allegiance. The chancellor’s men were already questioning disciples. To report the slip would betray Han Fei. To conceal it might doom them both.  

In the end, Li Si burned the slip. The act felt like both sacrifice and surrender. Han Fei watched the flames consume the evidence, his expression inscrutable. “You fear chaos,” he said, not unkindly. “But chaos is the uncarved block’s twin. To reject one is to misunderstand the other.” Li Si said nothing. He had made his choice, the way a river chooses its bed—by erosion, not intention.  

When Xunzi summoned them days later, his chambers thick with the scent of pine smoke, he held the vessel in his hands, now cracked down the center. “A servant found it thus,” he said, his voice weary. “A lesson, perhaps. Even the artisan’s hand cannot defy the fragility of his medium.” Han Fei opened his mouth, then closed it, the words trapped behind his stutter. Li Si spoke instead, smooth and measured. “Or a reminder, Master. That the vessel, once carved, may still break.” Xunzi’s eyes narrowed, but he nodded, the ghost of a smile beneath his beard.  

That night, Li Si dreamt of Song Yi, his body a vessel shattered into shards, each inscribed with a fragment of the *Xunzi*. Han Fei’s voice echoed through the fragments: *Rebellion is the shape of what we cannot say*. When he woke, the taste of ash was on his tongue, and the frost outside had hardened into a glassy sheen, reflecting nothing but the moon’s cold eye.
